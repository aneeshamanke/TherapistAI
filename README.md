Mental health struggles are real, and getting help shouldn't be complicated or expensive. I started this project because I believe technology can make support more accessible - not to replace human connection, but to provide a bridge when you need someone to listen.

This is just the beginning. Every commit, every feature, every improvement is driven by the belief that everyone deserves access to mental health support. The AI will get smarter, the features will grow, and together we'll build something that actually helps people.

If this project helps even one person feel less alone, it's worth it.
